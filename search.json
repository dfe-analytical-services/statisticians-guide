Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.\n\n\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at statistics.development@education.gov.uk.

No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.
